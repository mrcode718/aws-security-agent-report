      "Partial",
      "<strong>Description:</strong> The service tests for dependency version pinning and integrity verification, which indirectly helps identify when components may have known vulnerabilities by ensuring proper version tracking.\n<strong>Evidence:</strong> Improper inventory management action groups test for dependency version pinning and integrity verification in Dockerfiles and build configurations.\n<strong>Limitations:</strong> Explicit CVE scanning and vulnerability database lookups are not performed, limiting the ability to identify known vulnerabilities in components [UL-009]."
