      "CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity",
      "Covered",
      "<strong>Description:</strong> The service detects insufficient verification of data authenticity through improper inventory management testing that validates the presence of integrity checks for downloaded code and base images.\n<strong>Evidence:</strong> Improper inventory management action groups test for missing authenticity verification when downloading components and using base images without SHA256 digest pinning."

      "CWE-353: Missing Support for Integrity Check",
      "Partial",
      "<strong>Description:</strong> The service may detect missing integrity check support indirectly through improper inventory management testing of build configurations, but explicit validation of missing integrity check support in runtime application features is not systematically performed.\n<strong>Evidence:</strong> Improper inventory management action groups test for missing integrity checks in Dockerfiles and build configurations but do not explicitly test for missing integrity check support in runtime application behavior.\n<strong>Limitations:</strong> Explicit validation of missing integrity check support in runtime application features is not systematically performed [UL-007]."

      "CWE-426: Untrusted Search Path",
      "Covered",
      "<strong>Description:</strong> The service tests for untrusted search path vulnerabilities through local file inclusion and path traversal action groups that systematically test for file access outside intended directories.\n<strong>Evidence:</strong> Local file inclusion and path traversal action groups demonstrate comprehensive testing of untrusted search path vulnerabilities including various traversal techniques and encoding methods."

      "CWE-427: Uncontrolled Search Path Element",
      "Covered",
      "<strong>Description:</strong> The service detects uncontrolled search path elements through local file inclusion and path traversal testing that validates file access controls and directory restrictions.\n<strong>Evidence:</strong> Local file inclusion and path traversal action groups test for uncontrolled search path elements allowing access to files outside intended directories."

      "CWE-494: Download of Code Without Integrity Check",
      "Covered",
      "<strong>Description:</strong> The service includes dedicated improper inventory management testing action groups that systematically test for dependency version pinning and integrity verification in Dockerfiles and build configurations.\n<strong>Evidence:</strong> Improper inventory management validator tasks demonstrate comprehensive analysis of Docker base image pinning and component checksum verification, confirming robust integrity check testing capabilities."

      "CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data",
      "Covered",
