      "CWE-345: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity",
      "Covered",
      "<strong>Description:</strong> The service detects insufficient verification of data authenticity through improper inventory management testing that validates the presence of integrity checks for downloaded code and base images.\n<strong>Evidence:</strong> Improper inventory management action groups test for missing authenticity verification when downloading components and using base images without SHA256 digest pinning."
    ],
    [
      "CWE-353: Missing Support for Integrity Check",
      "Not Covered",
      "<strong>Description:</strong> The service does not include explicit testing for missing integrity check support in runtime application features.\n<strong>Evidence:</strong> Extended penetration testing confirmed no runtime integrity check testing was performed. Improper inventory management action groups test build configurations but protocol-level integrity check support testing is outside the web application penetration testing scope.\n<strong>Limitations:</strong> Integrity check support testing is not systematically performed [UL-007]."

    [
      "CWE-426: Untrusted Search Path",
      "Covered",
      "<strong>Description:</strong> The service tests for untrusted search path vulnerabilities through local file inclusion and path traversal action groups that systematically test for file access outside intended directories.\n<strong>Evidence:</strong> Local file inclusion and path traversal action groups demonstrate comprehensive testing of untrusted search path vulnerabilities including various traversal techniques and encoding methods."
    ],
    [
      "CWE-427: Uncontrolled Search Path Element",
      "Covered",
      "<strong>Description:</strong> The service detects uncontrolled search path elements through local file inclusion and path traversal testing that validates file access controls and directory restrictions.\n<strong>Evidence:</strong> Local file inclusion and path traversal action groups test for uncontrolled search path elements allowing access to files outside intended directories."
    ],
    [
      "CWE-494: Download of Code Without Integrity Check",
      "Covered",
      "<strong>Description:</strong> The service includes dedicated improper inventory management testing action groups that systematically test for dependency version pinning and integrity verification in Dockerfiles and build configurations.\n<strong>Evidence:</strong> Improper inventory management validator tasks demonstrate comprehensive analysis of Docker base image pinning and component checksum verification, confirming robust integrity check testing capabilities."
    ],
    [
      "CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data",
      "Covered",
      "<strong>Description:</strong> The service tests for deserialization vulnerabilities in Java applications through dedicated insecure deserialization action groups.\n<strong>Evidence:</strong> Penetration test findings demonstrate deserialization testing for Java applications including comprehensive testing attempting to exploit Java deserialization vulnerabilities."
    ],
    [
      "CWE-506: Embedded Malicious Code",
      "Not Tested",
      "<strong>Description:</strong> This vulnerability requires the presence of intentionally embedded malicious code in the application.\n<strong>Evidence:</strong> The tested applications are legitimate web applications without embedded malicious code, making this vulnerability not applicable.\n<strong>Limitations:</strong> "
    ],
    [
      "CWE-509: Replicating Malicious Code (Virus or Worm)",
      "Not Tested",
      "<strong>Description:</strong> This vulnerability requires the presence of self-replicating malicious code in the application.\n<strong>Evidence:</strong> The tested applications are legitimate web applications without self-replicating malicious code, making this vulnerability not applicable.\n<strong>Limitations:</strong> "

      "CWE-565: Reliance on Cookies without Validation and Integrity Checking",
      "Covered",
      "<strong>Description:</strong> The service detects cookie validation and integrity issues through dedicated Session token vulnerabilities and Privilege escalation testing.\n<strong>Evidence:</strong> Penetration test action groups include session token vulnerability testing that validates cookie handling and integrity. Testing includes client-side cookie manipulation for privilege escalation and session fixation vulnerability detection."
    ],
    [
      "CWE-784: Reliance on Cookies without Validation and Integrity Checking in a Security Decision",
      "Covered",
      "<strong>Description:</strong> The service detects cookie integrity issues in security decision contexts through dedicated Privilege escalation testing that validates cookie manipulation for authorization bypass.\n<strong>Evidence:</strong> Penetration test action groups include privilege escalation and session token vulnerability testing. Testing validates whether applications properly verify cookie integrity before making security decisions."
    ],
    [
      "CWE-829: Inclusion of Functionality from Untrusted Control Sphere",
      "Covered",
      "<strong>Description:</strong> The service tests untrusted functionality inclusion through Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) testing.\n<strong>Evidence:</strong> Penetration test action groups demonstrate SSRF testing across multiple applications. Tool tests untrusted functionality inclusion through server-side request forgery validation."
    ],
    [
      "CWE-830: Inclusion of Web Functionality from an Untrusted Source",
      "Partial",
      "<strong>Description:</strong> The service may detect inclusion of web functionality from untrusted sources through code scanner static analysis and security misconfiguration testing, but explicit testing for untrusted web functionality inclusion is not systematically performed.\n<strong>Evidence:</strong> Code scanner and security misconfiguration action groups may detect untrusted web functionality inclusion patterns but do not show explicit validation of untrusted web functionality inclusion.\n<strong>Limitations:</strong> Explicit testing for untrusted web functionality inclusion is not systematically performed [UL-007]."

      "CWE-915: Improperly Controlled Modification of Dynamically-Determined Object Attributes",
      "Covered",
      "<strong>Description:</strong> The service detects improper modification of object attributes through code scanner and business logic testing.\n<strong>Evidence:</strong> Penetration test findings demonstrate Mass Assignment Vulnerability finding with explicit detection of object attribute modification."
    ],
    [
      "CWE-926: Improper Export of Android Application Components",
      "Not Tested",
      "<strong>Description:</strong> This vulnerability is Android-specific and requires Android mobile application analysis.\n<strong>Evidence:</strong> The tested applications are web applications accessed through HTTP/HTTPS interfaces, not Android mobile applications, making this vulnerability not applicable.\n<strong>Limitations:</strong> "
