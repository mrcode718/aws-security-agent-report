      "CWE-117: Improper Output Neutralization for Logs",
      "Covered",
      "<strong>Description:</strong> The service successfully detects log injection vulnerabilities through dedicated Local File Inclusion and log poisoning attack testing.\n<strong>Evidence:</strong> Penetration test findings demonstrate log injection detection through LFI combined with log poisoning attack chains. Log poisoning is a form of log injection attack that can lead to remote code execution."
    ],
    [
      "CWE-221: Information Loss or Omission",
      "Covered",
      "<strong>Description:</strong> The service detects information loss or omission through dedicated Information disclosure testing that validates data handling and exposure.\n<strong>Evidence:</strong> Penetration test findings demonstrate information disclosure testing including user enumeration, sensitive information exposure in API responses, and debug endpoints exposing credentials. Information disclosure action groups test various information exposure scenarios."
    ],
    [
      "CWE-223: Omission of Security-relevant Information",
      "Covered",
      "<strong>Description:</strong> The service tests for security-relevant information omissions through information disclosure testing.\n<strong>Evidence:</strong> Penetration test action groups demonstrate information disclosure testing across multiple applications."
    ],
    [
      "CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File",
      "Not Covered",
      "<strong>Description:</strong> The service does not include testing for sensitive information insertion into log files in its standard testing scope.\n<strong>Evidence:</strong> Comprehensive review of penetration test runs found no evidence of log file content analysis or sensitive information logging validation.\n<strong>Limitations:</strong> Explicit testing for sensitive information insertion into log files is not systematically performed [UL-007]."

    [
      "CWE-778: Insufficient Logging",
      "Covered",
      "<strong>Description:</strong> The service successfully detects insufficient logging through dedicated findings that identify missing or inadequate audit logging for security-critical events.\n<strong>Evidence:</strong> Penetration test findings demonstrate comprehensive testing of audit logging capabilities including transaction logging validation, authentication event logging testing, and forensic metadata verification."
