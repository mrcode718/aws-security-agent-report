      "UL-004",
      "Complex exploitation scenarios requiring custom tooling or local services are unsupported. The agent runs as is with limited built-in tooling available, and internal guardrails reduce fluency, preventing support for advanced attack scenarios."

      "UL-006",
      "Agent does not have access to the runtime environment of the host under test (filesystem, OS, or application runtime), limiting analysis of file system-level permissions, ownership, temporary files, operating system-specific features, and runtime memory inspection to detect cleartext storage in memory or analyze memory-based vulnerabilities."
    ],
    [
      "UL-007",
      "Missing specific vulnerability testing capabilities - certain vulnerability types are not explicitly tested (e.g., CSRF, CRLF injection, log injection, cookie integrity checking, MFA, file upload testing, HTTP request/response smuggling, browser cache security testing, window.opener vulnerability testing, log file content analysis)."
    ],
    [
      "UL-008",
      "Limited static code analysis functionality and scope - code review module does not perform comprehensive analysis of all code quality patterns (e.g., variable/field modifiers, mass assignment patterns in all contexts). Additionally, code scanner does not perform comprehensive analysis of cryptographic implementation details via static code analysis (e.g., IV generation, nonce reuse, key pair reuse, RSA padding selection) or runtime random number generator testing (entropy, seed validation, PRNG algorithm analysis)."
    ],
    [
      "UL-009",
      "No dependency vulnerability analysis - tool scans dependency manifest files (package.json, requirements.txt, pom.xml, go.mod, composer.json) for framework identification but does not check component versions against vulnerability databases (CVE scanning, SBOM generation, transitive dependency analysis, maintenance status checking)."
