      "UL-008",
      "Limited static code analysis functionality and scope - code review module and code scanner does not perform comprehensive analysis of all code quality patterns (e.g., variable/field modifiers, file storage locations, default permissions, ownership verification, resource leaks, proxy/intermediary functionality, link following, open redirect, symlink following, external control of system/configuration settings, obsolete function detection, function call with incorrectly specified arguments, empty password detection in configuration files, unchecked return value, generic exception throwing declarations, missing default case, omitted break statements) and does not perform comprehensive analysis of cryptographic implementation details via static code analysis (e.g., key management practices, key exchange without entity authentication, application-level cryptographic key expiration, missing cryptographic steps, encryption strength in application-level implementations, weak hash functions, salt usage and predictability, computational effort parameters, risky cryptographic primitive implementations)."
