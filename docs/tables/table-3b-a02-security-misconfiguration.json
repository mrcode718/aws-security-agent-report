      "Partial",
      "<strong>Description:</strong> The service may detect configuration issues through code scanner and network scanner, but does not explicitly test for external control of system or configuration settings.\n<strong>Evidence:</strong> Configuration testing occurs through general scanning approaches rather than specific validation of configuration parameter sources and validation mechanisms.\n<strong>Limitations:</strong> Explicit testing for external control of system or configuration settings requires understanding configuration parameter sources and validation mechanisms which may not be systematically tested [UL-008]."

      "CWE-260: Password in Configuration File",
      "Partial",
      "<strong>Description:</strong> The service includes static analysis capabilities through code scanner, but explicit scanning for passwords in configuration files may not be systematically performed.\n<strong>Evidence:</strong> Code scanner focuses on important flows and framework analysis rather than comprehensive configuration file security scanning.\n<strong>Limitations:</strong> Configuration file password detection requires specific pattern matching for credentials that may not be comprehensively implemented in the code scanner [UL-008]."
