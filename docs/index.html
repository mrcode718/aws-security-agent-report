                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p>This report presents a comprehensive functional testing and assessment of AWS Security Agent, a security service in public preview that offers automated security reviews and penetration testing capabilities. The evaluation documents functional capabilities, configuration options, and observed limitations based on console testing and exploration conducted in the us-east-1 region. All three core capabilities—Design Security Review, Code Security Review, and Penetration Testing—were tested and found to be functional. The service demonstrates readiness for use in public preview, though limitations include console-only access, single-region availability, and restricted source control management integration. This assessment provides a foundation for evaluating the service's suitability for production security workflows.</p>

                <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
                <p>AWS Security Agent is a cloud security service currently in public preview that provides automated security assessment capabilities for web applications and code repositories. The service offers three primary capabilities: (1) Design Security Review for web applications, (2) Code Security Review for source code repositories, and (3) Penetration Testing for web application security testing.</p>
                <p>This report documents the results of functional testing conducted in December 2025, focusing on the service's operational capabilities, configuration options, integration mechanisms, and observed limitations. The testing was performed through the AWS Management Console in the us-east-1 region, as this is currently the only available region for the service.</p>

            <!-- Section 2: Methodology -->
            <section class="section">
                <h2>2. Methodology</h2>
                <p>The assessment was conducted through direct console interaction with AWS Security Agent. An Agent Space was created and configured with all three core capabilities enabled. The testing methodology included:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Agent Space creation and initial configuration</li>
                    <li>Security requirements configuration (AWS-managed and custom requirements)</li>
                    <li>GitHub integration setup and code review configuration</li>
                    <li>Penetration testing target domain configuration</li>
                    <li>Interface exploration and functional capability verification</li>
                </ul>
                <p>All testing was performed in the us-east-1 region using standard AWS console access. The assessment focused on functional capabilities rather than security effectiveness, as actual security reviews require access to target applications and repositories.</p>

                </table>

                <h3>3.2 Design Security Review</h3>
                <p>The Design Security Review capability is ready for use. The interface allows configuration of security requirements, with 12 requirements enabled in the test configuration (11 AWS-managed requirements plus 2 custom requirements). The capability requires web application access to perform actual reviews, which was not tested in this assessment.</p>

                <h3>3.3 Code Security Review</h3>
                <p>Code Security Review functionality was verified through GitHub integration. The OAuth-based integration process is functional, allowing repository selection and configuration. Pull request scanning can be enabled on a per-repository basis. Security requirements and vulnerability finding settings are configurable through the interface.</p>

                <h3>3.4 Penetration Testing</h3>
                <p>The Penetration Testing capability supports configuration of multiple target domains, including both Route 53 managed domains and custom domains. Domain verification is performed via DNS TXT record verification. The interface supports optional configuration of infrastructure context, including VPCs, CloudWatch logs, Lambda functions, Secrets, and S3 buckets, though none were configured in this assessment.</p>

            <!-- Section 6: Discussion -->
            <section class="section">
                <h2>6. Discussion</h2>
                <p>The functional testing demonstrates that AWS Security Agent is ready for use in public preview. All three core capabilities are functional and can be configured through the console interface. The service provides a comprehensive set of security assessment tools, though with notable limitations.</p>
                
                <h3>6.1 Strengths</h3>
                <p>The service demonstrates several strengths:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>All three core capabilities (Design Review, Code Review, Penetration Testing) are ready and functional</li>
                    <li>GitHub integration is successfully implemented and operational</li>
                    <li>Custom security requirements are supported, demonstrating platform flexibility</li>
                    <li>Domain verification process is available for both Route 53 and custom domains</li>
                    <li>Service role is automatically created and configured</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>6.2 Limitations</h3>
                <p>Several limitations were observed that may impact adoption:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Console-only access:</strong> The lack of CLI or API access limits automation and integration with CI/CD pipelines</li>
                    <li><strong>Single region support:</strong> Only us-east-1 is available, requiring all resources to be in this region</li>
                    <li><strong>Limited SCM support:</strong> Code review requires GitHub integration; no other source control management systems are supported</li>
                    <li><strong>Token expiration:</strong> Web application access requires time-limited authentication tokens that expire</li>
                </ul>

            <!-- Section 7: Conclusion -->
            <section class="section">
                <h2>7. Conclusion</h2>
                <p>The overall assessment of AWS Security Agent is positive. The service is functional and ready for use in public preview, with all three core capabilities operational. The GitHub integration works as expected, and custom security requirements demonstrate the platform's flexibility.</p>
                <p>However, the service is currently limited by console-only access and single-region support. These limitations may restrict adoption in automated workflows and multi-region deployments. It is recommended that organizations continue to evaluate the service as it matures and additional features, such as CLI/API access and multi-region support, become available.</p>
