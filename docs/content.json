  "abstract": "This study presents an initial functional and security coverage analysis of AWS Security Agent, a newly introduced AWS-managed, GenAI-enabled security assessment service designed to support design review, code analysis, and penetration testing within the software development lifecycle. The evaluation is based on empirical testing of the service, supplemented by a systematic review of publicly available AWS documentation. The study examines three core capabilities: design security review, code security review and on-demand penetration testing, evaluates their implementation characteristics, operational limitations, and coverage of the OWASP Top 10 (2025) application security risks. Results indicate support for context-aware, multi-step penetration testing and real-time pull-request analysis, with effective detection of injection vulnerabilities. OWASP Top 10 coverage analysis reveals significant variation across risk categories, with strongest coverage in injection vulnerabilities and access control, moderate coverage in security misconfiguration and insecure design, and weakest coverage in software supply chain security, cryptographic validation beyond TLS checks, and security logging. This work provides an objective, practitioner-focused assessment of current capabilities and limitations and does not constitute a security certification or endorsement of the service.",

        "Application security teams must secure applications as they evolve through design, coding and deployment. Traditional security reviews and penetration tests are typically manual and scheduled infrequently, leading to gaps and late findings. AWS introduced the \"Security Agent\" as a AI agent designed to embed security into each stage of the software development lifecycle [1]. The service was first publicly announced at AWS re:Invent 2025, held December 1-5, 2025, signaling AWS’s intent to operationalize generative AI-assisted security reviews within mainstream development workflows [2]. The agent provides design reviews, code security reviews and multi-step penetration testing within a centralized web interface, aiming to make expert-level security assessments available on demand and at scale [1]. The official documentation confirms that AWS Security Agent operates across AWS, on-premise, hybrid, multicloud, and SaaS environments [1] and consolidates findings from design, code and penetration tests in one place."

            "The design review capability allows security teams to upload design documents (architectural diagrams, system designs, data-flow diagrams and threat models) and assess them against organizational security requirements. The official AWS documentation confirms that AWS Security Agent shifts security left by providing real-time security feedback on design documents and assessing compliance with organizational security requirements before any code is written [1]. Security teams upload documents through the web application and receive remediation guidance to prioritize findings [1]. The agent supports custom security requirements-teams can define description, applicability, compliance criteria and remediation guidance for each requirement. During testing, it was noted that custom requirements are defined through free-text fields limited to 500 characters for descriptions and 10 000 characters for other fields, and the underlying model interprets them, which may change over time. The design review runs entirely in the external web application opened from the AWS console. Supported formats include markdown, PDF and common architectural diagram formats, but uploading is done manually; there is currently no CLI or API to automate submissions."

The official AWS documentation states that AWS Security Agent proactively secures applications by analyzing pull requests against organizational security requirements and common vulnerabilities like missing input validation and SQL injection risks [1]. Developers receive remediation guidance directly in their GitHub workflow [1]. The official AWS documentation for reviewing code security findings in GitHub confirms that code review is triggered when a pull request is marked as \"Ready for review\" in repositories where code review capability is enabled, and that draft pull requests are not analyzed [3]. The AWS News Feed article notes that the agent's code review checks GitHub pull requests for OWASP Top Ten vulnerabilities and policy violations [4]. The official AWS documentation only mentions GitHub integration [3]. During testing, it was observed that the public preview integrates only with GitHub via a GitHub App, supports up to 20 private repositories per integration [5] and does not scan public repositories. Pull requests are the only unit of analysis - full repository scans are not supported. Remediation guidance and suggested fixes are posted directly in the developer's workflow, but customizing the checks beyond the defined security requirements is limited."

            "AWS Security Agent's penetration testing capability performs multi-step attack simulations on web applications. The official AWS documentation confirms that AWS Security Agent delivers on-demand penetration testing by deploying specialized AI agents to discover, validate, report and remediate security vulnerabilities through tailored multi-step attack scenarios [1]. The agent understands the application's context by analyzing source code and documentation to identify and exploit vulnerabilities that automated security scanning tools cannot find [1]. It documents findings with impact analysis, reproducible attack paths, and creates pull requests with ready-to-implement code fixes [1]. The official AWS documentation for creating penetration tests specifies that only verified domains can be included in penetration tests and that VPC configuration is only required for testing private applications hosted within an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud [6]. It is promoted as automating context-aware penetration tests that scale across many applications [4]. The National CIO Review notes that the agent continuously scans workloads for vulnerabilities and performs penetration testing tailored to the application's structure and intended behavior, eliminating the need to wait for human‑led assessments [7]. The ComputerWeekly report adds that the agent understands the design, code and security requirements of a workload and can create a customised attack plan to expose vulnerabilities before an application reaches production [8]. During testing, it was noted that all penetration tests require a verified domain (with DNS TXT record) [6], and for private applications hosted within a VPC, additional VPC configuration is also required [6]. Tests can include contextual artifacts such as API documentation, threat models, source code archives and GitHub repositories. Only HTTP/HTTPS targets are supported; custom ports and other protocols are not. The agent creates multiple action groups (information disclosure, business logic vulnerabilities, unrestricted resource consumption, authentication bypass, etc.), uses static analysis tasks to inspect the source, and then launches validators that exploit vulnerabilities to minimise false positives. The risk categories available for testing include arbitrary file upload, code injection, command injection, cross‑site scripting (XSS), insecure direct object references, JSON Web Token vulnerabilities, local file inclusion, path traversal, privilege escalation, server‑side request forgery (SSRF), server‑side template injection, SQL injection and XML external entity attacks."

The service was tested with basic design documents, and it was observed that policies such as \"Secure by Default, Tenant Isolation, Secret Protection, Trusted Cryptography, Audit Logging, Authorization, Log Protection, Information Protection, Privileged Access and Authentication\" were applied. When the design intentionally violated requirements, the agent failed corresponding policies; when the design mentioned the required topics, half of the policies were marked as needing more details. Uploading irrelevant documents led to all policies being marked not applicable. Custom security requirements worked as expected; a test rule designed to block specific fictional terms was triggered when related keywords appeared in variable names. However, the manual upload process and lack of automation make it difficult to integrate design review into CI/CD pipelines. During testing, it was noted that the underlying language model performing analysis is not documented; thus the behaviour may change as models are updated. This lack of determinism makes it difficult to rely on the tool for strict policy enforcement."

There is no support for public repositories, and integration with other source control systems (Bitbucket, GitLab, CodeCommit) was not present in the preview. The tool offers two modes: one to check custom security requirements and another to detect \"security vulnerability findings\" that resemble the output of Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer; the latter uses rules similar to open-source tools like Bandit and Infer."

            "To start a penetration test, users must verify ownership of a target domain by creating a DNS TXT record. Automatic verification via Route53 often fails, requiring manual DNS record creation. The penetration testing workflow opens in an external web application separate from the main AWS console. Tests can target an external domain or run from within a VPC; however, the tool does not support VPCs using the 10.0.0.0/16 CIDR because it conflicts with the agent's addressing. Custom ports and non-HTTP protocols are unsupported; specifying a port in the URL causes the run to start but never succeeds. When a VPC is selected, outbound internet connectivity is required even to fetch GitHub context. Penetration tests also request CloudWatch log groups as destinations, but pre-created log groups sometimes fail validation due to undocumented naming conventions; leaving the field blank allows the agent to create log groups automatically. Contextual resources can include S3 buckets (only plaintext API documentation, threat models or zipped source code archives), GitHub repositories and plain‑text credentials via the UI. Lambda functions and Secrets Manager entries are used solely to provide authentication credentials. During scanning, the agent builds a sitemap, performs static analysis of frameworks, business logic, important flows and misconfigurations, and then launches validator tasks for risk categories such as arbitrary file upload, code and command injection, XSS, IDOR, JWT vulnerabilities, local file inclusion, path traversal, privilege escalation, SSRF, SSTI, SQL injection and XML external entity attacks. The agent uses tools like testssl.sh to check TLS configurations. It produces detailed findings with CVSS scores, exploit steps and remediation guidance. However, exploitation of complex vulnerabilities that require running external tooling or interacting with local services (labelled \"Hard\" during testing) is not supported. Custom exploitation code added to the context caused hallucinations - e.g., the agent incorrectly marked a vulnerability as CVE-2021-21311 based on proof for CVE-2018-7667. Additionally, the service prohibits creation of custom infrastructure or use of localhost services, limiting validation of sophisticated scenarios."

        "AWS Security Agent represents a shift toward continuous, embedded application security. It automates design and code reviews, runs realistic multi-step penetration tests and centralizes findings, enabling teams to identify issues earlier and reduce manual effort. The service's context-aware approach, custom security requirements and multi-step attack simulations are valuable features.",
        "However, the preview version has notable limitations: it is available only in one region, requires manual configuration through a web interface, supports only private GitHub repositories, lacks scheduling and API automation (scheduled testing is explicitly documented as unavailable [9]), and cannot handle complex exploitation scenarios or non-HTTP protocols. Only GitHub integration is supported; other SCM systems (GitLab, Bitbucket, CodeCommit) are not available [3]. The service provides strong coverage for injection vulnerabilities and access control, moderate coverage for security misconfiguration and insecure design, but has significant gaps in software supply chain security, cryptographic validation beyond TLS checks, logging and alerting, and data integrity failures. To fully secure their applications, organizations should use AWS Security Agent as a complementary control alongside additional tools and processes (e.g., dependency scanning, secrets management, infrastructure‑as‑code security, and runtime monitoring) and maintain human expertise for nuanced assessments."
