  "abstract": "This study presents an initial functional and security coverage analysis of AWS Security Agent, a newly introduced AWS-managed, GenAI-enabled security assessment service designed to support design review, code analysis, and penetration testing within the software development lifecycle. The evaluation is based on empirical testing of the service, supplemented by a systematic review of publicly available AWS documentation. The study examines three core capabilities: design security review, code security review and on-demand penetration testing, evaluates their implementation characteristics, operational limitations, and coverage of the OWASP Top 10 (2025) application security risks. Results indicate support for context-aware, multi-step penetration testing and real-time pull-request analysis, with effective detection of injection vulnerabilities. However, the service is limited to a web-based interface, lacks CLI or API access, and exhibits partial OWASP coverage, with gaps in software supply chain security, cryptographic validation, and security logging. This work provides an objective, practitioner-focused assessment of current capabilities and limitations and does not constitute a security certification or endorsement of the service.",

        "Application security teams must secure applications as they evolve through design, coding and deployment. Traditional security reviews and penetration tests are typically manual and scheduled infrequently, leading to gaps and late findings. AWS introduced the \"Security Agent\" as a AI agent designed to embed security into each stage of the software development lifecycle [1]. The service was first publicly announced at AWS re:Invent 2025, held December 1–5, 2025, signaling AWS’s intent to operationalize generative AI–assisted security reviews within mainstream development workflows [2]. The agent provides design reviews, code security reviews and multi‑step penetration testing within a centralized web interface, aiming to make expert‑level security assessments available on demand and at scale [1]. The official documentation confirms that AWS Security Agent operates across AWS, on-premise, hybrid, multicloud, and SaaS environments [1] and consolidates findings from design, code and penetration tests in one place."

            "The design review capability allows security teams to upload design documents (architectural diagrams, system designs, data‑flow diagrams and threat models) and assess them against organizational security requirements. The official AWS documentation confirms that AWS Security Agent shifts security left by providing real-time security feedback on design documents and assessing compliance with organizational security requirements before any code is written [1]. Security teams upload documents through the web application and receive remediation guidance to prioritize findings [1]. The agent supports custom security requirements-teams can define description, applicability, compliance criteria and remediation guidance for each requirement. During testing, it was noted that custom requirements are defined through free‑text fields limited to 500 characters for descriptions and 10 000 characters for other fields, and the underlying model interprets them, which may change over time. The design review runs entirely in the external web application opened from the AWS console. Supported formats include markdown, PDF and common architectural diagram formats, but uploading is done manually; there is currently no CLI or API to automate submissions."

The official AWS documentation states that AWS Security Agent proactively secures applications by analyzing pull requests against organizational security requirements and common vulnerabilities like missing input validation and SQL injection risks [1]. Developers receive remediation guidance directly in their GitHub workflow [1]. The official AWS documentation for reviewing code security findings in GitHub confirms that code review is triggered when a pull request is marked as \"Ready for review\" in repositories where code review capability is enabled, and that draft pull requests are not analyzed [3]. The AWS News Feed article notes that the agent's code review checks GitHub pull requests for OWASP Top Ten vulnerabilities and policy violations [4]. The official AWS documentation only mentions GitHub integration [3]. During testing, it was observed that the public preview integrates only with GitHub via a GitHub App, supports up to 20 private repositories per integration [5] and does not scan public repositories. Pull requests are the only unit of analysis - full repository scans are not supported. Remediation guidance and suggested fixes are posted directly in the developer's workflow, but customizing the checks beyond the defined security requirements is limited."

            "AWS Security Agent's penetration testing capability performs multi‑step attack simulations on web applications. The official AWS documentation confirms that AWS Security Agent delivers on-demand penetration testing by deploying specialized AI agents to discover, validate, report and remediate security vulnerabilities through tailored multi-step attack scenarios [1]. The agent understands the application's context by analyzing source code and documentation to identify and exploit vulnerabilities that automated security scanning tools cannot find [1]. It documents findings with impact analysis, reproducible attack paths, and creates pull requests with ready-to-implement code fixes [1]. The official AWS documentation for creating penetration tests specifies that only verified domains can be included in penetration tests and that VPC configuration is only required for testing private applications hosted within an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud [6]. It is promoted as automating context‑aware penetration tests that scale across many applications [4]. The National CIO Review notes that the agent continuously scans workloads for vulnerabilities and performs penetration testing tailored to the application's structure and intended behavior, eliminating the need to wait for human‑led assessments [7]. The ComputerWeekly report adds that the agent understands the design, code and security requirements of a workload and can create a customised attack plan to expose vulnerabilities before an application reaches production [8]. During testing, it was noted that all penetration tests require a verified domain (with DNS TXT record) [6], and for private applications hosted within a VPC, additional VPC configuration is also required [6]. Tests can include contextual artifacts such as API documentation, threat models, source code archives and GitHub repositories. Only HTTP/HTTPS targets are supported; custom ports and other protocols are not. The agent creates multiple action groups (information disclosure, business logic vulnerabilities, unrestricted resource consumption, authentication bypass, etc.), uses static analysis tasks to inspect the source, and then launches validators that exploit vulnerabilities to minimise false positives. The risk categories available for testing include arbitrary file upload, code injection, command injection, cross‑site scripting (XSS), insecure direct object references, JSON Web Token vulnerabilities, local file inclusion, path traversal, privilege escalation, server‑side request forgery (SSRF), server‑side template injection, SQL injection and XML external entity attacks."

The service was tested with basic design documents, and it was observed that policies such as \"Secure by Default, Tenant Isolation, Secret Protection, Trusted Cryptography, Audit Logging, Authorization, Log Protection, Information Protection, Privileged Access and Authentication\" were applied. When the design intentionally violated requirements, the agent failed corresponding policies; when the design mentioned the required topics, half of the policies were marked as needing more details. Uploading irrelevant documents led to all policies being marked not applicable. Custom security requirements worked as expected; a test rule designed to block specific fictional terms was triggered when related keywords appeared in variable names. However, the manual upload process and lack of automation make it difficult to integrate design review into CI/CD pipelines. During testing, it was noted that the underlying language model performing analysis is not documented; thus the behaviour may change as models are updated. This lack of determinism makes it difficult to rely on the tool for strict policy enforcement."

There is no support for public repositories, and integration with other source control systems (Bitbucket, GitLab, CodeCommit) was not present in the preview.

            "To start a penetration test, users must verify ownership of a target domain by creating a DNS TXT record. Automatic verification via Route53 often fails, requiring manual DNS record creation. The penetration testing workflow opens in an external web application separate from the main AWS console. Tests can target an external domain or run from within a VPC; however, the tool does not support VPCs using the 10.0.0.0/16 CIDR because it conflicts with the agent's addressing. Custom ports and non‑HTTP protocols are unsupported; specifying a port in the URL causes the run to start but never succeeds. When a VPC is selected, outbound internet connectivity is required even to fetch GitHub context. Penetration tests also request CloudWatch log groups as destinations, but pre‑created log groups sometimes fail validation due to undocumented naming conventions; leaving the field blank allows the agent to create log groups automatically. Contextual resources can include S3 buckets (only plaintext API documentation, threat models or zipped source code archives), GitHub repositories and plain‑text credentials via the UI. Lambda functions and Secrets Manager entries are used solely to provide authentication credentials. During scanning, the agent builds a sitemap, performs static analysis of frameworks, business logic, important flows and misconfigurations, and then launches validator tasks for risk categories such as arbitrary file upload, code and command injection, XSS, IDOR, JWT vulnerabilities, local file inclusion, path traversal, privilege escalation, SSRF, SSTI, SQL injection and XML external entity attacks. The agent uses tools like testssl.sh to check TLS configurations. It produces detailed findings with CVSS scores, exploit steps and remediation guidance. However, exploitation of complex vulnerabilities that require running external tooling or interacting with local services (labelled \"Hard\" during testing) is not supported. Custom exploitation code added to the context caused hallucinations - e.g., the agent incorrectly marked a vulnerability as CVE‑2021‑21311 based on proof for CVE‑2018‑7667. Additionally, the service prohibits creation of custom infrastructure or use of localhost services, limiting validation of sophisticated scenarios."

The service verifies that authorization decisions are consistently enforced at runtime, bound to server-side session context rather than user-supplied identifiers, and that unauthenticated or unauthorized requests are reliably rejected.\n\nEvidence: Evidence from penetration test runs demonstrates comprehensive coverage through dedicated action groups: \"Privilege escalation\" with validator tasks and \"Insecure direct object reference\" with validator tasks. Findings include privilege escalation vulnerabilities identifying that any authenticated user can access admin functionality, violating least privilege; authentication bypass vulnerabilities demonstrating bypassing access control through parameter tampering; IDOR vulnerabilities demonstrating insecure direct object reference detection; and dedicated action groups for metadata manipulation testing.\n\nCoverage Summary: Requirements fully covered include least privilege, access control bypass, IDOR, missing access controls, privilege escalation, and force browsing. Some requirements are partially covered.\n\nLimitations: To enable comprehensive authorization assurance and complete privilege boundary validation, it is important to provide the agent with access to application source code, authentication information, API documentation with full endpoint and role-mapping information. Without this context, validation of complex authorization logic, multi-role privilege escalation paths, and conditional access controls remains inherently limited.\n\nAdditional Notes: Partial coverage details: (1) Metadata manipulation (JWT, cookies, hidden fields): The service tests for metadata manipulation through dedicated \"Json web token vulnerabilities\" action groups and session manipulation tests (e.g., session fixation vulnerabilities). However, comprehensive testing of all metadata manipulation vectors (cookie tampering, hidden field manipulation, JWT invalidation abuse) may be limited without full application context, as the service requires knowledge of all authentication mechanisms and token formats used by the application. (2) CORS misconfiguration: The service may detect CORS misconfigurations through network scanning and TLS/SSL validation tools (testssl.sh version 3.2.2) in the \"Network scanner\" action group. However, comprehensive CORS testing requires specific validation of cross-origin access controls, including testing of allowed origins, credentials handling, and preflight request validation, which may not be explicitly tested in all scenarios without dedicated CORS-specific test cases."

However, the service does not assess infrastructure as code (IaC) files (e.g., Terraform, CloudFormation, Ansible) or cloud service permissions (e.g., IAM policies, S3 bucket permissions, security groups, VPC configurations). This limitation means that cloud-native security misconfigurations at the infrastructure layer are not evaluated, requiring organizations to use dedicated IaC security scanning tools alongside AWS Security Agent. (2) Disabled security features in upgraded systems: The service may identify misconfigured security features through framework and TLS analysis (e.g., Flask debug mode detection, CSRF protection configuration analysis). However, explicit detection of disabled security features in upgraded systems requires historical comparison of security feature configurations before and after upgrades, which is not clearly demonstrated. The service focuses on identifying active misconfigurations in the current state rather than assessing whether security features were intentionally disabled during system upgrades or whether backward compatibility decisions led to insecure configurations."

Design review can enforce \"Trusted Cryptography Best Practices\" organizational requirements.\n\nEvidence: Evidence from penetration test runs demonstrates detection of plaintext password storage (Critical severity) through static code analysis, identifying that administrator passwords are stored without cryptographic hashing or encryption. Code scanner detects plaintext credentials in source code but does not specifically scan for hardcoded cryptographic keys.\n\nCoverage Summary: Partial coverage. TLS/SSL configuration validation is covered. Application-level cryptographic analysis is partially covered.\n\nLimitations: The service does not automatically analyze cryptographic primitives, detect insecure algorithms beyond TLS checks (e.g., DES, RC4, MD5, SHA1 in application code), validate initialization vectors or encryption modes, check for deprecated hash functions, assess cryptographic randomness, or analyze cryptographic error messages and side channel vulnerabilities.\n\nAdditional Notes: Organizations should use dedicated cryptographic analysis tools alongside AWS Security Agent to address requirements related to encryption implementation details, hash function validation, and cryptographic randomness. Partial coverage details: (1) Weak cryptographic algorithms or protocols: The service can enforce cryptographic policies through design review (\"Trusted Cryptography Best Practices\" organizational requirements) and validates TLS/SSL configurations using testssl.sh (version 3.2.2), which checks for weak protocol versions (e.g., SSL 2.0, SSL 3.0, TLS 1.0, TLS 1.1) and weak cipher suites. However, the service does not automatically detect weak cryptographic algorithms in application code (e.g., DES, RC4, MD5, SHA1 used in application logic, not just TLS). The code scanner analyzes source code patterns but does not specifically analyze cryptographic primitives or algorithm choices in application code beyond TLS/SSL configuration. (2) Cryptographic algorithm downgrade or bypass: The service validates TLS/SSL protocol versions through the TLS scanner, which may detect protocol downgrade attacks (e.g., TLS 1.2 being downgraded to TLS 1.0). However, it does not validate application-level cryptographic algorithm downgrade or bypass vulnerabilities (e.g., applications that allow weaker encryption algorithms to be selected through negotiation, or applications that can bypass cryptographic controls through parameter manipulation). The service focuses on transport-layer cryptography (TLS/SSL) rather than application-layer cryptographic implementation details."

Penetration tests and static code analysis detect business logic vulnerabilities that reveal insecure design patterns. Evidence from penetration test runs demonstrates detection of business logic vulnerabilities indicating insecure design, including missing transaction limits and velocity controls, insufficient balance validation, negative balance exploitation, self-transfer business logic flaws, registration atomicity failures, float precision errors in monetary calculations, transaction history denial of service, missing transaction confirmation controls, lack of step-up authentication, and missing account status controls.\n\nCoverage Summary: Partial coverage. Design review and business logic vulnerability detection are covered. SDLC methodology assessment is not covered.\n\nLimitations: Complex insecure designs may not be detected if requirements are incomplete or if the upload process is skipped. The service does not explicitly assess whether organizations follow SDLC methodologies, threat modeling practices, or security training programs.\n\nAdditional Notes: Partial coverage details: (1) Gathering requirements and resource management: The service provides design review capabilities that assess uploaded architectural documents against security requirements (e.g., Secure by Default Best Practices, Tenant Isolation Best Practices, Authorization Best Practices), enabling validation of requirements gathering and resource management practices. However, coverage is dependent on design documents being manually uploaded by users. If the upload process is skipped or documents are not provided, the service cannot assess requirements gathering or resource management practices.

Authentication bypass, rate limiting, session management, and password storage issues are covered. Credential stuffing, account lockout, and MFA effectiveness testing are not covered.\n\nLimitations: The service does not perform password spraying, account lockout tests, credential stuffing validation, default credential testing, breached credential validation, credential recovery testing, MFA fallback testing, or credential scope/audience validation.\n\nAdditional Notes: Partial coverage details: (1) Missing or ineffective multi-factor authentication: Design reviews can enforce MFA requirements through \"Authentication Best Practices\" policies, which include \"Implement MFA for sensitive operations\" as a compliance criterion. Penetration tests detect missing step-up authentication for high-value operations (Medium severity), which is related to MFA requirements for risk-based authentication. However, the service does not explicitly test for MFA implementation or effectiveness during runtime penetration testing. The service can assess MFA requirements at the design level but does not validate that MFA is properly implemented, configured, or functioning correctly in the running application. (2) Session identifier exposure: The service detects session management vulnerabilities including session fixation (High severity), which demonstrates detection of session identifier reuse after successful login. While the specific finding relates to session regeneration rather than session identifier exposure in URLs, the service's session management testing would likely detect insecure session identifier storage. However, comprehensive testing of all session identifier exposure vectors (URLs, hidden fields, client-side storage) may require full application context to identify all session management mechanisms used by the application."

However, it does not actively test whether applications log these events consistently or validate log completeness. The service identifies that logging is missing but does not verify that logging works correctly when implemented. (2) Warning and error log messages (indirectly covered): The service indirectly detects inadequate error logging through findings related to error handling and audit logging deficiencies, which indicate errors are exposed via HTTP responses rather than being properly logged. However, it does not specifically test whether warnings and errors generate adequate or clear log messages. The service detects that error handling is inadequate but does not validate the quality or completeness of log messages. (3) Sensitive information in logs (indirectly covered): The service indirectly detects sensitive information leakage through error handling findings and access control testing (A01), which would detect if logging events are visible to unauthorized users. However, it does not specifically test whether sensitive information (PII, PHI) is inappropriately logged or whether logging events are visible to unauthorized users. The service detects information disclosure through errors but does not validate that sensitive data is not logged or that log access is properly restricted. (4) CloudWatch logging (covered for pentest execution only): The service sets up CloudWatch logging infrastructure (log groups, log streams, S3) for pentest execution during the \"Setup infrastructure\" phase, demonstrating its capability to send logs to CloudWatch.

Multiple injection findings (SQL injection, command injection, code injection, XSS) indicate missing input validation and sanitization. However, the service does not specifically test whether inputs are validated for type, length, range, format, encoding, and allowed values at all system boundaries (UI/API/files/webhooks/queues).

        "However, the preview version has notable limitations: it is available only in one region, requires manual configuration through a web interface, supports only private GitHub repositories, lacks scheduling and API automation (scheduled testing is explicitly documented as unavailable [9]), and cannot handle complex exploitation scenarios or non‑HTTP protocols. Only GitHub integration is supported; other SCM systems (GitLab, Bitbucket, CodeCommit) are not available [3]. Regarding OWASP Top 10 coverage, AWS Security Agent provides good coverage for injection vulnerabilities (A05) and partial coverage for access control, security misconfiguration, insecure design, and authentication issues. However, it does not address software supply chain failures, cryptographic failures beyond TLS checks, logging and alerting issues, or mishandling of exceptional conditions. To fully secure their applications, organizations should use AWS Security Agent as a complementary control alongside additional tools and processes (e.g., dependency scanning, secrets management, infrastructure‑as‑code security, and runtime monitoring) and maintain human expertise for nuanced assessments."
