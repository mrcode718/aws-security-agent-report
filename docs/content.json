  "abstract": "This report presents a comprehensive functional testing and assessment of AWS Security Agent, a security service in public preview that offers automated security reviews and penetration testing capabilities. The evaluation documents functional capabilities, configuration options, and observed limitations based on console testing and exploration conducted in the us-east-1 region. All three core capabilities—Design Security Review, Code Security Review, and Penetration Testing—were tested and found to be functional. The service demonstrates readiness for use in public preview, though limitations include console-only access, single-region availability, and restricted source control management integration. This assessment provides a foundation for evaluating the service's suitability for production security workflows.",

        "However, the service is currently limited by console-only access and single-region support. These limitations may restrict adoption in automated workflows and multi-region deployments. It is recommended that organizations continue to evaluate the service as it matures and additional features, such as CLI/API access and multi-region support, become available."
